                <p>Hello, my name is Emily Goeres. In order to get to know me I think it is helpful to start with my
                    background and where I grew up, as this helped shape who I am today. I was born in Bangalore, India
                    and was born with albinism. I was adopted when I was about two years old to a family of five in a
                    small, one stoplight farming town in western Washington. My family has a three generational dairy
                    farm, which is where I learned about work ethic. Growing up, everyone in my family played their part
                    in helping with the chores. I worked before school, after school, the weekends and summers. Even on
                    Christmas morning, Santa didn’t come until the cows were taken care of and all chores were done.
                    Looking back, I remember thinking of these tasks as just chores, but now I understand how much I
                    learned that I now use in my everyday life, such as patience, understanding the outcome of hard
                    work, things don’t come for free, and being able to adapt to any situation that gets presented to
                    me. I loved every second of it and being able to work side by side with my dad daily was the best
                    gift anyone could ever give me. There are so many memories that came from growing up on the farm
                    that not just myself but also my friends and family will cherish forever.
                </p>
                <p>My educational background is unique, coming from a small farming town, my school was a tiny, red,
                    100-year-old, three room building with an old bell that would alert the start and end of the school
                    day. Attending Satsop Elementary School made me feel like Laura Ingalls Wilder, as there were 50
                    kids between kindergarten to 6th grade, we played in the dirt at recess, the classrooms only had
                    chalkboards, and most went home to farm at the end of the day. Middle school and high school were
                    spent in Elma, where the entire town focused on the Friday Night football game. Growing up in a
                    small town was awesome, some of my greatest friendships were made in that little red schoolhouse and
                    carried on when I transferred to Elma in middle and high school. When it came time to pick a
                    college, I knew from the start I was going to be a COUG! Not only was I raised a COUG, but every
                    trip to Pullman was always filled with so many memories. Whether it was going to Ferdinand’s for ice
                    cream, watching a football game in Martin Stadium, going to Sella’s for a calzone or just seeing my
                    older siblings having the time of their lives, Pullman always made me feel at home. During my time
                    at WSU I worked full time at Ferdinand’s learning how to make Cougar Gold Cheese. I started at the
                    bottom learning the basics and worked my way up to head cheesemaker, which meant I was finally able
                    to have my name printed on the can of Cougar Gold. After 4 wonderful years in Pullman, I graduated
                    in May of 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in Hospitality Business Management.
                </p>
                <p> My first job out of college was with National Food Corporation where I oversaw the production of
                    liquid egg product. I was the assistant plant manager and oversaw 80+ employees. It was interesting
                    as my entire staff was 20+ years older than me, but with my background and education, I fit right in
                    and we dominated! After a few years I decided to go into a new field and got into residential
                    property management with Pinnacle Property Management. My first property was in Mercer Island and it
                    was a 645-unit property, which was the biggest in the portfolio. I worked my way up from a leasing
                    consultant to a multi-site property manager. I then challenged myself by taking part in a startup
                    property management company, where I moved to Colorado to work for Avanti Residential. Avanti then
                    moved me to Arizona to take the lead of some of their new properties, while I also specialized in
                    coaching and training new employees on the Avanti standards. Throughout my career journey, I know I
                    have had a diverse background going from dairy, to agriculture to property management. I feel
                    through these different fields I have always kept learning and excelling. I know there is a lot that
                    I can bring to a company, and with my experience working and my passion to keep learning I can be
                    successful in your company. I have loved my past fields, as they have led me to my next opportunity,
                    but I cannot wait to start a new chapter within the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>Enough about work, my personal life is always an adventure. Some of my favorite things to do are
                    going razor clam digging, cooking, traveling, hiking and of course, in a normal year, watching
                    COUGAR FOOTBALL! A few years ago, I adopted an an albino cat named Snow, who has moved all over the
                    united states with me. I also love spending time with friends and family and visit my mom in Half
                    Moon Bay very often. Wherever I am, I am always having a good time and making the most of every
                    moment. I hope you enjoyed learning about me, and I look forward to meeting with you and bringing my
                    education and career background to your company. Together I know we will go far!
