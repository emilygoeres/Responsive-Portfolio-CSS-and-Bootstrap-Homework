                <p>Hello, my name is Emily Goeres. My educational background is unique, coming from a small farming town
                    it only made sense to be a COUG and attend Washington State University. After 4 wonderful years at
                    Washington State I graduated in May of 2014 and received a bachelorâ€™s degree in hospitality business
                    management. My first job out of college was with National Food Corporation where I oversaw the
                    production of liquid egg product. I was the assistant plant manager and oversaw 80+ employees.
                    After a few years I decided to switch gears and got into residential property management with
                    Pinnacle Property Management. With Pinnacle I worked my way up from a leasing consultant to a
                    multi-site property manager within a year and a half. I then challenged myself by taking part in a
                    startup property management company, where I moved to Colorado to work for Avanti Residential.
                    Avanti then moved me to Arizona to take the lead on the takeovers for their new properties, while also
                    specializing in coaching and training new employees to the Avanti standards. My career path has been
                    diverse starting from dairy, to food production to property management. Through these
                    different fields I have always kept learning and excelling. I know there is a lot that I can bring
                    to a company, with my work ethic and passion to keep learning I can be successful with
                    your company. I have loved my past fields, as they have led me to my next opportunity, but I cannot
                    wait to start a new chapter within the tech industry.

                </p>
                <p> My personal life is always an adventure. Some of my favorite things to do are
                    razor clam digging, cooking, traveling, hiking and of course, watching COUGAR FOOTBALL! A few
                    years ago, I adopted an albino cat named Snow, who has moved all over the united states with me. I
                    also love spending time with friends and family. Wherever I am, I am always having a good time and
                    making the most of every oppertunity. I hope you enjoyed learning about me, as I look forward to meeting
                    with you and bringing everything I have to offer to your company. Together I know we will go
                    far!
                </p>
