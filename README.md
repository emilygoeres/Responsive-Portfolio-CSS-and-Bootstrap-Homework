Homework How I completed Assignment:
-Added 3 HTML pages: contact, Index and Portfolio
Added the same nav bar to each index and updated the info on the nav bar
-Made the nav bar a hamburger style as the page gets smaller
-Updated the title for each page to be About Me Homework 2
-On Contact html, made it so the form was underneath the nav bar
-Added 5 images to the portfolio page
